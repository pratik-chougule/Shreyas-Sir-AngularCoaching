Undefined
The Undefined primitive type denotes all uninitialized variables in TypeScript and JavaScript.
 It has only one value, which is undefined. The undefined keyword defines the undefined type in TypeScript,
  but it is not useful because we can only assign an undefined value to it.

  Any Type
It is the "super type" of all data type in TypeScript. It is used to represents any JavaScript value.
 It allows us to opt-in and opt-out of type-checking during compilation.
  If a variable cannot be represented in any of the basic data types,
   then it can be declared using "Any" data type.
    Any type is useful when we do not know about the type of value (which might come from an API or 3rd party library), 
    and we want to skip the type-checking on compile time.
